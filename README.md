# genetic-mdp
This tool uses [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/) to solve the [maximum diversity problem](https://grafo.etsii.urjc.es/optsicom/mdp) using a genetic algorithm. In other words, given a set of N points, this tool attempts to find the M point subset where the average distance between every pair of points in the subset is maximal.
